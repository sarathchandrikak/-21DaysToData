## Bad Pie Chart 

Here's the image of pie chart that seems to be bad.

This is because: 

1. Missing title or no proper title.
2. Dirty data or unclean data.
3. No proper indication or labeling to colors.
4. No measure specification. 
5. No labels.

## Good Pie Chart

Here's the image of same pie chart developed by me in Tableau.

Following are the advantages of this pie chart over other:

1. Proper title what the pie chart represents.
2. Cleaned data, only specifying classes that seem to be appropriate.
3. Proper indication of colors, like what color represents what.
4. Included measures like count, percentage of total for the crimes.
5. Proper labelling of age groups.
