# ♦️ #21DaysToData Learnings

1. Day 1 

    * It's all about the introductions and intro to the challenge
    * A basic data test 

2. Day 2 

    * Today's learnings were on data lifecycle, data vocabulary, types of data, types of analytics.
    * Data lifecycle: It ranges from data collection to deployment. Data collection, data storage, data cleaning, data exploration, data visualisation, data modelling, data communication and deployment.
    * Data Vocabulary: It discussed different words related to the data world. Data Analysis, Data Science, Data Engineering, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI, Big Data, Cloud Computing.
    
    
    Types of data: Qualitative (Nominal, Ordinal) and Quantitative (Discrete, Continuous)\
    Types of analytics: Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, Perspective.

        1. Descriptive: What happened?
        2. Diagnostic: Why did it happen?
        3. Predictive: What will happen? What might happen?
        4. Perspective: What can be done to achieve? Further steps

3. Day 3 

      * Today its all about the different data careers available. Data Analyst, Data Engineer and Data Scientist. 
      * Path to transition to these careers.

4. Day 4

    * It's a discussion on data cleaning. There are six types of dirty data.
  
      * Misentries - > Spellings, typos, inconsistent data logging
      * Duplicates -> No row is repeated 
      * Missing Data -> NaN's empty data
      * Combining Data Sources -> Combining two or more sources of data
      * Unwanted outliers -> Deciding upon what to do with the outliers
      * Quality check -> Data Quality Check 
  
    * Open Refine is the tool which I got to know for data cleaning.
