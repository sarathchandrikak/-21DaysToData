    * It's a discussion on data cleaning. There are six types of dirty data.
  
      * Misentries - > Spellings, typos, inconsistent data logging
      * Duplicates -> No row is repeated 
      * Missing Data -> NaN's empty data
      * Combining Data Sources -> Combining two or more sources of data
      * Unwanted outliers -> Deciding upon what to do with the outliers
      * Quality check -> Data Quality Check 
  
    * Open Refine is the tool which I got to know for data cleaning.
    * All the data cleaning steps can be found [here](https://github.com/sarathchandrikak/21DaysToData/blob/main/data_district.ipynb)

5. Day5

      * Descriptive Statistics gives insights about the data. Different columns have been analysed.
